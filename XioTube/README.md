# XioTube :: A YouTube Clone

This  GitHub Repository is for XioTube - a clone of Youtube. This is basically just for me; and for you because you get free code and I get a good backup. You can change your Videos, Thumbnails, e.t.c as usual.

## Run Locally

Clone the project and Run it on XAMPP (**PS:** I would recomend a self-hosted domain for this step, it makes this process more satisfying and aesthetically pleasing.)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/l-xdt/xiotube
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xiotube
```

Install XAMPP (via Choclatey ~ if you don't have it).

```bash
  choclately install xamp
```

Start the server

```bash
  [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```

PS: Here is the manual on how to create a self-hosted domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (By Soeng Song)

## Roadmap

- More Browser and intergrations to Android

- Having a banner for you to customize to your liking.

- Add as much videos as you would like to the platform - only viewable to ypi.

- Written by Hand.

- Written in Front-end languages (no frameworks, just vanilla): **HTML, CSS & JavaScript**.

- Still has the XT in the Style of (now) YouTube as the FavIcon in the folder ~ named Favicon (**truly..**).

## FAQ

#### Can I change up, add or modify any of the code I would like?

Yeah! The project is for you. You are supposed to make it your own likes and tastes - for you to modify and to play around with. You may do whatever you would like with it basically.

#### Can I host this, if I can How?

I have said previously that you can host it on 127.0.0.1 (a.k.a your computer's ip). Use whatever you would like to host it. If you do find new findings we will update this slowly. But for this we reccomend XAMPP - eventhough hosting on WAMP is possible. 

Here are my two tutorials for hosting: mentioned earlier, how to host it yourself - linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) and for more intermidiates, how to use it with a free domain online ~ as-long as you are not missing out on anything. linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs).

#### Any PS's for the questions

**PS:** You don't really need to host this on XAMPP just to use it you can just use it on the HTML alone, that is fine, but we really do recommend that...
